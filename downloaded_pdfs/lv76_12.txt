              achieved by an applicant who received an offer of a place on the
              course. The mid point is the points score of the applicant in the
              middle of a list of offerees placed in points score order. Applicants
              who are offered places might not necessarily accept a place. In most

              the Leaving Certificate. Applicants offered on mature grounds are not
              accounted for in this chart, with the exception of applicants for
              Mature Code nursing courses.
