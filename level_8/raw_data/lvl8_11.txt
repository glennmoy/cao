              The details given are for general information only and do not form part of any
              contract. They are not intended for use in determining whether any individual
                  applicant is or is not entitled to an offer of a higher education place.

    *     Not all on this points score were offered places
    **    Matriculated candidates are considered but admission is on

  AQA      All qualified applicants
          Notes: The final points column shows the lowest points score achieved by an
          applicant who received an offer of a place on the course. The mid point is the points
          score of the applicant in the middle of a list of offerees placed in points score order.
          Applicants who are offered places might not necessarily accept a place. In most
          cases, the points scores shown here are based on performance in the Leaving
          Certificate. Applicants offered on mature grounds are not accounted for in this chart,
          with the exception of applicants for Mature Code nursing courses.
