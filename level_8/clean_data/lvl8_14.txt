              The details given are for general information only and do not form part of any contract.
               They are not intended for use in determining whether any individual applicant is or is
                                not entitled to an offer of a higher education place.

              Notes: The Final points column shows the lowest points score achieved by an
              applicant who received an offer of a place on the course. The Mid point is the points
              score of the applicant in the middle of a list of offerees placed in points score order.
              Applicants who are offered places might not necessarily accept a place. In most
              cases, the points scores shown here are based on performance in the Leaving
              Certificate. Applicants offered on mature grounds are not accounted for in this chart,
              with the exception of applicants for Mature Code nursing courses.
