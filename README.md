Statistical analysis of CAO data 2001-2015

In this directory:

/downloaded_pdfs contains the pdf files containing all the data I scraped from the CAO website. 
Here they are also converted to .txt files.

/level_6-7 contains all data relating to Level 6 and 7 courses. This is all still raw.

/level_8 contains data relating to Level 8 courses. This is the data I performed the analysis on.

/points_awarded contains the data relating the points awarded to Leaving Cert candidates.


In sub-directories:

/raw_data is where I scraped the .txt files for the relevant data and converted to .dat files

/clean_data is where I convert the .dat files into a .csv DataFrame.

/analyse_data is where I perform the analysis on the .csv files. 
Note the *col.csv files are human-readable
